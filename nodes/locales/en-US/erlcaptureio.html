Capture the I/O of selected processes.

Used to capture the I/O of existing Erlang processes or function nodes within Erlang-Red.

Can also be used to send input to a process by sending the node a message.

### Inputs

: payload (any) : what is expected as payload input.
: pid (string) :  Process id `<1.2.3>` or registered node to which the payload should be sent the next time a io get is done.

### Outputs

: payload (any) : the node generated output using `io:format(..)` or something else that works via the I/O protocol.

### Description

Listen in on the I/O of processes, modules, functions and behaviours.

See the [I/O Protocol](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/io_protocol.html) for a details. This node captures messages generated by process and sent to their group leader. This node works by replacing the group leader for the chosen process.
